## `/language-learning/notebooks_` directory

This directory contains development notebooks.  
Default suggested `conda` environment: `ull-dev` created from `ull_dev_env.yml` 
or `ull_dev_spec.txt` unless other environment specified in a notebook.  

**ATTN**: Running development notebooks from `master` branch 
in production `conda` environment created from `/language-learning/environment.yml` 
can lead to unpredictable consequences.  
**Please avoid this idea.**
