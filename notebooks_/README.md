This directory contains development notebooks.  
Default suggested `conda` environment: `ull-dev` created from `conda-env-ull-dev.yml`  
unless other environment specified in a module.

**ATTN**: Running these notebooks from `master` branch 
in production `conda` environments created from 
`/language-learning/environment.yml`, `conda-env-ull.yml`, `conda-env-ull-cli` files 
can lead to unpredictable consequences.  

**ATTN**: Running these notebooks from `master` branch 
in production `conda` environment created from `/language-learning/environment.yml` 
can lead to unpredictable consequences.  
**Please avoid this idea.**
