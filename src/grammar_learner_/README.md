## `/language-learning/src/grammar_learner_` directory

This directory contains grammar learner modules under development.  
Default suggested `conda` environment: `ull-dev` created from `conda-env-ull-dev.yml`  
unless other environment specified in a module.

**ATTN**: Calling development stage functions from code or Jupyter notebooks  
in production `conda` environments created from 
`/language-learning/environment.yml`, `conda-env-ull.yml`, `conda-env-ull-cli` files     
can lead to unpredictable consequences.  
**Please avoid this idea.**
