## `/language-learning/src/grammar_learner_` directory

This directory contains grammar learner modules under development.  
Default suggested `conda` environment: `ull-dev` created from `ull_dev_env.yml` 
or `ull_dev_spec.txt` unless other environment specified in a module.

**ATTN**: Calling development stage functions from code or notebooks 
in production `conda` environment created from `/language-learning/environment.yml`  
can lead to unpredictable consequences.  
**Please avoid this idea.**
